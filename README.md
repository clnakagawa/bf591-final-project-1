# Final Project for BF591 (R for Biological Sciences)

This project is an RShiny dashboard for analyzing and visualizing RNA-seq data from a study looking at Huntington's Disease. It implements four main tabs, with one for inspecting sample information data, count matrices from the experiment, differential expression results, and gene set enrichment analysis results.
